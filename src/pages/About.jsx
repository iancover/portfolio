        <h1 className='text-orange'>About Me</h1>
        <p className='text-dark'>
          Moved to Austin, TX in 2012 to further my career in the tech industry
          and worked for multiple software start-ups in sales roles covering
          diverse verticals from domestic Mid-markets to international
          Enterprise levels; with increased exposure to the technical side of
          the SaaS industry at every turn.
          <br />
          After a couple of years of entertaining the idea of a career
          transition into programming, in 2017 I enrolled in a full stack web
          development bootcamp. Near completion of the program later that year,
          feeling solely equipped with the fundamentals, rather than rushing
          into the field partially prepared, I decided to delay my plans and
          take that next step only when the timing felt right. I have since been
          focused on learning all aspects of the full stack developer path,
          working on multiple projects to further my experience, while faced
          with multiple challenges, including a global pandemic.
